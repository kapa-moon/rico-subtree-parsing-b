### Play around with the dataset
Tried to visualize the mapping between the json file and the jpg file (make it js object/ html)
Tried with a mini part from 1.json

#### Some ideas on rules of cutting: 
cut "small components" first, not just horizontally, so that little parts such as buttons will not be merged into the wider components etc.
